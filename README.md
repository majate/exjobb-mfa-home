# Exjobb MFA - Home micro frontend
This is the "Home" micro frontend for a [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) micro frontend application developed for a degree project at KTH.

Each micro frontend used by this application has its own repo (this repo only contains one of the micro frontends). If you want to run the entire application, you need to install/build/run all of the micro frontends as well as the root configuration.

The code for the other parts can be found here:
- [The root configuration](https://github.com/majate/exjobb-mfa-root)
- [The header micro frontend](https://github.com/majate/exjobb-mfa-header)
